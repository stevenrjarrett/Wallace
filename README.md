# Wallter
3D-printable wallet with card-fanning ability. It's definitely not perfect, we'll see how far I get with it.

* Can fan cards out
* ID window
* simple (few pieces)

Eventual:
* Card fanning is reliable
* Magsafe compatible on both sides.
* Includes a spot for cash. maybe also keys, coins, a tracker, knife, etc.
* zero fasteners needed.
* cards locked more securely
* sliding mechanism clicks into place.
* RFID blocking?


## Setup, ecosystem, etc.
